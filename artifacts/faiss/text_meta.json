I’ve had to stop wearing cosmetics, and my skin routine has felt like a part time job. I also have several allergies, and the antihistamines I have to take make my skin/lips even more dry. I’ve apparently become overly sensitized to ingredients in 95%+ of commercial lip balm products, “natural” ingredients/products. No matter how much water I drink, very healthy diet, hyaluronic acid supplements & topical hyaluronic acid + occlusives, running a humidifier, staying indoors, etc., nothing has helped the severe, painful peeling of my lips for the past 3-4 years. It’s been embarrassing and has made talking, eating and drinking an uncomfortable and painful.<br /><br />Everything I tried seemed to make this even worse, so I eventually gave up on lip balm. I tried “nothing,” (just to see if I actually needed lip balm- that was a mistake!). I resorted to trying single ingredient options, just to help identify what the problem ingredient might be: testing by applying only straight argan, olive, safflower or squalane oils (messy, shiny, and doesn’t last without an occlusive layer added on top), straight manuka honey (messy, sticky, expensive and only made me want to lick my lips all day lol). Made my own manuka honey, argan oil and beeswax product (worked pretty well but oh so messy, time consuming to make).<br /><br />Finally gave up on that and was only able to use Vanicream ointment (dermatologist recommended and similar to Vaseline but without the petrochemical odor- I can’t use products like Vaseline or Aquaphor FWIW). But even that wasn’t working well because i needed to be SO careful not to apply too much, or the ointment would eventually  migrate onto my face (usually while sleeping), which would cause rosacea flares (heavy occlusives seal in moisture but can also trap in just enough heat to cause a rosacea flare).<br /><br />But that messy solution that only stopped **some** of the peeling temporarily, and never resolved the issue entirely. Even applying every hour on the hour didn’t make much of a difference. My lips were still chapped feeling/peeling every day, just slightly less chapped.<br /><br />But THIS STUFF IS WHAT ALL LIP BALMS ARE MEANT TO BE! I am not exaggerating when I say that within an hour or so after applying this for the first time, I noticed my lips didn’t feel rough any longer… for the first time in YEARS!!! Weird, right?!! I didn’t believe it could be possible at first, but it’s truly  like I’ve never had chapped, peeling lips. Miracle in a tube!<br /><br />This must be what Goldilocks looks for when her lips are chapped: It doesn’t burn. It doesn’t sting. It doesn’t taste weird. It’s not too shiny or greasy feeling. It just makes my lips feel smooth and soft. You can faintly taste the elderberry/manuka honey when applying but it doesn’t linger. It’s not overpowering or flavorful enough to make you inadvertently lick your lips, which I always seem to do with “yummy” lip balm products.<br /><br />It just works. My grad school student son also loves it for the same reasons. It just makes your lips feel and look like lips are supposed to feel and look like. It’s long lasting, and when it does eventually lwear off, you won’t get that “rebound dryness” you might get from products like Eos, Chap-Stick and Burt’s Bees.

Tupelo Honey lip balm for a while and it’s the BEST I’ve ever used! But it’s hard for me to find locally, so this was a score! My lips have always gotten severely chapped no matter how much water I drink, no matter what I do. I take medications that make my mouth and skin feel dry, so fighting chapped lips is  a never-ending battle. I’m never without at least one tube of lip balm within arm’s reach!<br />I’ve used almost every non-petroleum based “premium” lip balm out there, and I’ve tried coconut oil, Shea butter, lanolin, you name it. I’ve been settling for Burt’s Bees and Dr. Bronners, both of which feel pretty good but don’t seem to last very long.<br />This is the first lip balm I’ve tried in 40+ years that seems to actually work! It goes on much more smoothly, tastes *really* good but isn’t overpowering at all, and actually helps keep my lips soft! Finally!!!<br />For anyone wondering, the key lime flavor is really good! I’d never tried it before, but since I love key lime pie, I took a chance. It really does taste like key lime! Not overpowering or artificial tasting and seems to work just as well as the Tupelo honey flavor.<br />The seller shipped this quickly, and with a nice personal touch. Thank you so much!

I live in Florida so the sun (especially in summer time) can blister my lips if they aren't protected.  I also get really chapped lips in the winter from the dry air, so I basically use lip balm year round.  The lip balm goes on silky smooth and smells amazing.  I don't know if it is flavored because I avoid licking my lips, because that just chaps them more and makes the situation worse. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a pain to get the stick to move up when you twist the bottom.

Unsure why my lips get chapped, perhaps I talk way too much 😉<br /><br />Locally, I'll purchase Burt's Bees or whatever natural products are available. Online lends vast selections with potential skepticism about quality. These were great because they were all unique in scent/taste of essential oils and yet all the same composition between sticks. I really like Lavender, as it's relaxing and mentally can be a cognitive clearer before bed. The Cinnamon Orange is an excellent combination as I like the combination of smell and flavor. Peppermint a classic scent always enjoyed and like the quality of the oils they use.<br /><br />Ingredients, as listed, are simply Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E and essential oils. These are the same types of ingredients I'd used when attempting to craft my own lip balms. It's fun to make them at home and yet with inexpensive prepackaged offerings like this readily available, it becomes unnecessary to create the mess when great ones like this are merely a quick mouse click away.<br /><br />They come in a nice box with all four smells/flavors (one is totally unscented, just a slight pleasant aroma from the shea butter and almond oil, I really like this one too). It would work nicely as a gift. I like how the different tubes are different colors for the different essential oils used, so I don't have to look and read each one as the composition of materials each look the same (orange doesn't look orange as they don't use extra ingredients) and it's easy to switch between them.

I used canva to create the label, printed it on vinyl sticker paper and a cricut machine to cut it once it was printed. It sounds easy peezy right? No! The SIZE of the tube was the problem! No matter how many you tube videos I watched nobody had this size tube and I went through I don't know how many pages (plain paper, mind you) printing out a sample until I got the measurements right. So for those of you who want to do the same (yes I am selling lip balm and needed a label for retail) the correct measurement is 1.6x2.0... the height will give you just enough room to clear both the top and the turn circle (or whatever its called) at the bottom. The width however is just shy of touching. you can even expand it to 2.1 if you want your label to overlap.<br />Overall I like the tubes, I haven't had any problem with them other than the fact that they are truly small, but they're sturdy and have very little leakage, they are a good deal for the price.<br />But remember, if you're selling your lip balms or just want to pretty it up with a label, the measurements are 1.6x2.0.<br />Enjoy!", "image_url": null, "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review_id": "4a77627a-be91-4486-b6c1-5c6bfdfa8c6c", "text": "I fell in love with EOS on my cruise in October.

My family jokes that I'm the only person they know who ends up with a sunburn on Thanksgiving and Christmas living in zone 6A. It's sad, but true. And if you've ever had sunburned lips, you know it's something you don't want a repeat of. Blisters and cracking are terrible, but on your delicate lips they make speaking and eating torture.<br /><br />I'm quite pleased with these so far. Panama Jack is a great brand and known for their sun care products. The lip balm is excellent. It has a broad spectrum of sunscreen included, the scents are great and tropical, it goes on feeling smooth and moist, and it lasts! It need reapplied every two hours or every 80 minutes if you're in water, but it definitely helps! I can feel it on my lips, although it goes on smooth and soft, and I know it's working to keep me from getting burned. Honestly, I'm not sensitive to any of the ingredients and in a pinch, it's even great to put on my nose to protect it in the harsh winter, but sunny conditions here.<br /><br />The multi pack was an awesome value. Seven balms cost less than getting three or four separately. My only negative was that the lid on my mango was busted, but it is still moist and I used an old balm lid to make sure it didn't dry out. I'll definitely get more of these. They don't really have a taste, but they smell amazing. They're clear to white in color and don't deposit any color or stain on my lips.<br /><br />Reputable brand and skin protection! I can keep one in the house, one in the car, one in my purse, one in the medicine kit, and then extras for when I run out or lose one!", "image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61e824g3kaL._SL1600_.jpg", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review_id": "058e0e95-57ef-4c9d-b791-d2abbde8915e", "text": "This Panama Jack Sunscreen Lip Balm - SPF 45 is a good product.

I lick my lips a lot which in turn leaves them dried out often, this does a good job of replenishing the moisture to them. I also like to wear matte lipsticks which are notorious for dehydrating the lips and this counteracts that, in fact I even wear a light coating of this under my lipsticks. I like that this doesn't have an overly greasy texture or appearance when applied. It only gives a slight glisten to the lips and it's not too thick.<br /><br />The smell is kind of herbal or maybe slightly minty but it's very light and not noticeable. It does eventually go away after application if you happen to not be a fan of the scent. It doesn't have any disgusting taste either, which was a huge plus.<br /><br />I think these lips balms are a great value, it comes with 2 and the containers are huge. I don't think I've seen any lip balms in this large of a container. Best of all, the ingredients are all natural and petroleum free.<br /><br />The only complaint I had is that it's fairly hard, I have to use my nail to break it up and scrape a small chunk out. It melts on your lips and applies easily once it's out but it's kind of a pain getting out the container. You COULD just rub your finger across the top but that took forever since I would only get a small amount that way.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with the quality and amount of these lip balms. I would absolutely purchase this brand again in the future.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I was in no way compensated and have no incentive to leave either a positive or negative review. These are my personal thoughts and opinions on this product.

My first thought was that I was chewing into a Big Red stick of gum. So if you like Big Red gum then this is basically a lip balm version of that. I do like the way it makes my lips feel tho. I get really bad chapped lips in the cold winter time, and this has helped keep my lips moisturized and soft. Its not too greasy, and its not too dry either (like burts bees), and the cinnamon gives it a very slight tingle where you can tell and feel like its sort of plumping your lips.

It's a really nice, smooth, emollient, buttery lip gloss/balm with decent staying power. It lasts on the lips, and doesn't require too frequent re-application. It also has a comfortable, smooth slip to it, and it is not sticky. The balm is yellow, but it goes on sheer. It doesn't look tinted on the lips.<br /><br />The flavor is lilikoi, which is apparently another way of saying passion fruit. I'm not usually keen on passion fruit flavor, but this one is surprisingly nice. The flavor/scent is sweet and pleasantly fruity. Like a sweet, very lightly floral-perfumed fruit. It's really nice, and not at all off-putting or overpowering.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent. The graphics and colors are beautiful. I also really like how the applicator is dome-shaped, with no sharp edges or openings to damage the lips. It makes it very easy to squeeze out the lip balm and apply it quickly. The formula and applicator also makes it difficult to squeeze out more than you intended, and that's important. I have found that feature lacking in some other lip products, and I've wasted a lot of product unnecessarily.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy to have this lip gloss/balm, and I will continue using it. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice glossy lip balm to try.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Rhus Verniciflua Peel Wax, Rhus Succedanea Fruit Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Natural Flavor, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tribehenin, Sorbitan Isostearate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Oil, Monoammonium Glycyrrhizinate, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Carmine, Tin Oxide.", "image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716qTBp3+tL._SL1600_.jpg", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review_id": "31aaff7c-c2f9-42a3-a13e-d0fed3b00458", "text": "These taste and work great, a little pricey for chap stick.

Rarely do anything that I don't have a lip balm ready to use at any moment. It's sitting all over the house, at least three varieties in my purse, extras in my travel make up kit--it's EVERYWHERE. While I'd gotten to the point where I only bought the more natural products either from the &#34;health food store&#34; type companies, or online, boutique type companies, Even bought lip oil that comes in a small roller bottle. Have hated some and I haven't loved any of them a lot. Started doing aromatherapy last April. Took two online courses from a reputable aromatherapy company--Natural Living and Butters & Balms. Started making a lot of my skincare products. Even made some of my own herb infused oils as a base for my homemade lip balms and oils. Hadn't love any of those, either. Actually took everything and added beeswax to it to make my own &#34;Healing Lip Balm.&#34; I like it a lot, but will never be able to replicate it:)<br /><br />I had recently bought a natural lip balm that I just loved; however, it didn't have an SPF factor. When I saw the Cal Pharma SPF 30 Mango Lip Balm at a discount for an honest review, I thought I'd try it. I must not have looked at the ingredients when I ordered it (which is VERY unusual for me) because I would have noticed the active ingredients:  Avobenzone 3 %, Homosalate 7.5%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 2.75%, Oxybenzone 6%. I have sensitive, allergic, reactive, rosacea skin and am allergic to most commercial sunscreens. In addition to these ingredients, the SPF 30 Mango Lip Balm contains Undecylcrylene Dimethicone. The only one of these chemicals that I could confirm was natural was the Homosalate. Not sure how they call this a natural product. My only excuse is that I'm going to Florida in a few weeks to visit my mother and wanted a lip balm with an SPF factor.<br /><br />Aside from the issue with the chemicals, I've tried this a few times. For one, the texture is very waxy--too much beeswax. I also feel a tingle on my lips and an itch in my throat, so suspect I'm having an allergic reaction to the SPF 30 Mango Lip Balm. This product is not for me. If you don't have allergic/sensitive skin, and don't care as much about ingredients, this product might be for you. Your other choice is physical blockers--like zinc or titanium oxide. And they give you that whitish cast. Not real desirable, either.<br /><br />I did receive a discount on this product with the expectation that I provide an honest review.

I keep the balm rolled back down after use to avoid smushing it up with a poorly aimed replacement of the lid. The balm itself is soft and smells and tastes good. It makes your lips shine and feel protected and healthy. If you have severely chapped lips, this particular product is probably not so useful (a medicated lip cream would be a better treatment), but if your lips are just dry and feel need protection, this is perfect. All the ingredients are natural, and the actual quantity seems bigger than the usual lip care product, so it may last longer, depending on how often you use it.

Thanks to Hudson and James Cloud Lip Balm my lips are still looking, and feeling, great.  I received the balm inside a short, round, 0.5-ounce glass jar.  It came tightly sealed inside a form-fitting bubble-wrapped envelope.  There was a tiny, round transparent protective seal on the jar and its large black lid.  The seal is not very effective.  I was able to easily open the cap without realizing the seal was there.  The print on the jar is very tiny.  After looking at the jar several times with a magnifying glass, I couldn't locate an expiration or a best by date.  Many hygiene product don't have them but they should.  These dates let me know if the ingredient are still fresh.<br /><br />I use the Cloud Lip Balm twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.  The balm feels nice on my lips.  It is very easy to smooth all over my lips.  It reminds me of some expensive high-end lip butter that I once owned.  The jar is small enough to fit inside the pockets of my jeans.  During the day, I use Carmex Classic Lip Balm when necessary.  The Cloud Lip and the Carmex are working together well to protect my lips and to keep them appearing healthy and attractive.  I've been faithfully using the Cloud Lip Balm for nearly three weeks and have not experienced any adverse side effects or allergic reactions.  It doesn't have a noticeable scent.  Also, I would like to note that the balm has a light-yellow waxy color whereas Amazon's website shows it to have a creamy white color.<br /><br />The Hudson and James Cloud Lip Balm doesn't sting or burn my lips after applying it; I hardly notice that it is there.  What I do notice is that my lips are feeling and looking great despite the change in seasons.  I wish I knew the price of the lip balm.  At the time of this review, it wasn't available for purchase.

Has a very mild orange scent, but nothing artificial. Not sticky at all and I like that it's in a glass jar. I was surprised by the term \"cloud\" in the name since this was hard and dense. Depending on the temperatures of your climate, both cocoa and shea harden up quite a lot but will melt at certain higher temperatures. Shea butter is easy to whip but this seems like it was just melted down and poured. I thought it would be more fluffy. I like that the ingredients are organic and fair trade but I still can't seem to justify the cost.

I wanted to keep it for myself, it smelled so good. He loves it.<br /><br />So, I ordered this travel-sized set for him to try. He’s a kind of wash-and-go guy but I this set will be a nice set for him to try out something new.<br /><br />Do note these bottles are small—they are travel-sized; think travel or sample sized. They won’t last long. This is a starter set or something you do take to travel with.<br /><br />There is a shampoo/body wash, a facial scrub, facial moisturizer, and a lip balm.<br /><br />The shampoo and body wash has almost the same type of scent as the candle—not as spruce tree forward but it does have a pine-y woodsy scent. I see other reviews compare it to floor cleaner but I like the scent—the reason people may think that is the pine scent may remind some of some types of floor cleaner, but for me it is a fresh woodsy-pine-scent.<br /><br />The facial scrub has tiny beads in it. The scent isn’t quite as apparent in the scrub as it is in the shampoo/body wash. It does have an exfoliating quality to it.<br /><br />The moisturizer is unscented. It’s a light moisturizer. It’d be good for my guy in winter when our air is particularly dry.<br /><br />I like the lip balm a lot. It’s very emollient and feels super good going on (I tried it!) It has a cool refreshing feel to it after you apply it. Really nice lip balm.<br /><br />I think my bf will like this set a lot to try out using specialized skin care products instead of just using soap on his face and go.<br /><br />Rugged & Dapper is a little on the pricy side for someone who’s doesn’t follow a skin-care regime so I don’t know that he’d purchase these items again; however, the price isn’t all that bad for someone who does regularly use specialty skin-care products.<br /><br />He’ll enjoy this set, but if he does not like something, I’ll come back to report that here.<br /><br />I hope my review helped you today.", "image_url": null, "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review_id": "78c84138-c8ff-44ff-b1a9-3d9078ea6447", "text": "Well it broke after 2 days...

The first time I just stopped using it and my lips went back to the way they were to be.

First of all, some background::<br /><br />My go-to lip balm of choice is a CBD infused balm from a company called 'Nature's Root'. THAT product is the ABSOLUTE BEST I've ever used. Not only does it last long, but it ACTIVELY HEALS my lips. The downside is that the Nature's Root balm is not exactly cheap; it's the same price as this 'Merry Hempsters' brand more or less. What makes the Nature's Root lip balm so expensive is the shipping: $25.00 shipping fee. So if I buy three $7.00 Nature's Root lip balm, I get charged a 25.00 shipping fee. If I only buy ONE, I still get charged the 25.00 shipping fee. Unfortunately I don't have that kind of cash to dole out all the time, so I am currently on the hunt for a suitable replacement.<br /><br />That's where this product, 'Merry Hempsters' comes in. I purchased the 2 pack Spearmint flavor, because it was the closest thing this company offered to the 'Nature's Root' product I use.  Now first let me say that I am ABSOLUTELY AWARE that there is a big difference between CBD and hemp. I understand that hemp will NOT have the same healing and pain relief qualities as CBD, but I had hoped this product would still be a good balm to try. The reviews here all seem pretty good, and as a bonus, the company promised to include a free powdered drink mix with my purchase of lip balm.<br /><br />Long story short...THEY LIED.<br /><br />My 2 lip balm tubes came haphazardly wrapped in clear, thin bubble wrap. There was NO drink mix included. Now, I'm not really a fan of pre-sweetened, powdered drinks anyway, but the fact that I was promised this and did not receive still annoys me. For me, the best way to test a new lip balm is to take my toothbrush, add a small dot of toothpaste, and gently brush my lips to exfoliate them. This way, you don't have any leftover film or residue from your previous lip balm, gloss, or lipstick (or food), and will be able to better gauge the quality of the new balm. Afterwards, I rinsed my lips, patted the excess water away with a baby-wipe, and applied the balm. This product is VERY waxy and basically just sits on top of your lips. A good quality lip balm (to me) goes on creamy, helped by your body's natural heat, and absorbs into your lips. Your lips should feel moist, soft and supple without feeling sticky, (tacky) or dry.<br /><br />This product did not do that.<br /><br />It had a waxy, slightly greasy feel and did not seem to moisturize at all. In fact, it actually made my lips MORE chapped, and I found myself having to reapply this stuff MULTIPLE TIMES within the hour. As a result, I went through that first tub in a matter of DAYS. THIS IS NOT OKAY. To make matters worse, as I neared the bottom of the tube, the remaining balm began BREAKING APART AND CRUMBLING. I have NEVER had that happen before.<br /><br />In all, I would NOT recommend this product. The company did NOT include the free drink mix AS PROMISED, and the product itself made my lips even MORE chapped. There is also absolutely NO HEALING factor included, despite the fact that the ingredients list looks nice.

What sets it apart is how deeply moisturizing & softening it is. It isn't waxy, like Burt's Bees for example, which creates a heavy coating on your lips but, for me, doesn't do anything long-term. This isn't the type of lip balm that your lips get \"addicted\" to, where you need more and more coats. In fact, many lip balms I've used end up being more drying than anything. Dr. Bronners lip balm isn't just managing my dry lips, but actually improving them! My lips get so dry that they get little scales that I need to exfoliate away, but after a day or two of using this lip balm the scales go away and my lips become soft again.

Therefore, each mini balm on its own should cost no more than $1.00, and if offered in a combo pack, should include a discount.

I have been rotating between three flavors, mint, cherry, and vanilla, but I always carry one with me.  These things last!  They are much better than any generic I have tried, and my lips aren't a chapped, uncomfortable mess.  I am very happy I tried these and recommend them highly.  A quick word on the flavors I have tried.  I like the mint when I am on the go.  It has a light, natural flavor that is strong enough to notice, but not so strong that it is overwhelming.  The balm is uncolored, so there is no concern about it looking like lip gloss or lipstick.  I like the cherry as a change of pace, but it is tinted a light shade of pink, and while I don't notice the color on my own lips (I have a medium skin tone), I would test it before wearing it in public if color is a concern.  The vanilla, well... different people have different tastes.  I won't say it is bad, but I like the other two flavors much more.  My issue with the vanilla is that the cocoa butter in the balm is very noticeable in scent and flavor, and when I apply it, my mind is immediately taken to thinking &#34;sun block, or sunscreen.&#34;  The fragrance and flavor remind me more of a skin lotion than something I would reach for to put on my lips.  Some people may like that, but I prefer something else.  That, however, is the only negative I found.  The product itself is outstanding, it does exactly what one wants it to do, and saves the user money as compared to using other similar products.  If you are debating on this one, try it.  I don't think you will be disappointed.<br />---<br />Original review:  April 20, 2015:<br />I was a bit skeptical when I saw this - how good can it be at this price?  Well, I don't know how they do it, but this is better than most of the name brand stuff.  It is the perfect price that you can keep it in a pocket and if you happen to lose it, there are plenty more where it came from.  You don't have to think of the cost every time you use it, but the best part is you won't need to reapply frequently (at least I don't, and I tend to go through lip balm quickly.  I have extremely dry lips that are prone to chapping and cracking).  This is my favorite flavor.  It is a very light, natural mint without being overwhelming.  It is lip balm, after all, and not breath freshener.  I also like the black case which is nice and masculine (but they have white and translucent cases for the ladies, too!).  I will definitely buy this again, but with 50 tubes in a batch, that might be a while - and that's not a bad thing, either.", "image_url": null, "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review_id": "24343970-77ef-40c0-a60e-f179403582a6", "text": "Great product!", "image_url": null, "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review_id": "c461bc10-e6bd-4748-8f94-7934fb41660a", "text": "Love my tins...
