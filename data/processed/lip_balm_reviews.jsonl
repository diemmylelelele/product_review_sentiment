{"text":"If you find yourself reaching for lip balm throughout the day, you may want to upgrade to a lip mask. It works either at night or during the day. This one has a light vanilla scent that can be used by anyone. It doesn't just coat your lips. It actually nourishes and gently exfoliates. A little goes a long way. It makes a good base for other lip products. I highly recommend it.<br \/><br \/>Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

{"text":"I got this KLAVUU Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack and have been using it nightly for a few weeks now. I have found that it is tasteless, odorless and does give me very soft lips by the next morning. However, it is extremely thick and sticky and it doesn't absorb very well. I apply it right before bed and no matter how careful I am to apply a very small amount I always need to use a tissue to dab the excess off so my lips don't stick to my pillowcase and so lint isn't attracted to and stick to my lips while I sleep. So, even though I have soft lips in the A.M., this is a pass for me.","images":[],"sentiment":"neutral","image_url":null}

{"text":"This set of lip balm is very nice. It applies easily and leaves your lips feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy or tacky. They taste of tangerine which is great. I admit, for lip balms I want one that has a good flavor at this point and this one delivers 100%. It is packed with great for your lips ingredients such as hemp seed oil, Vitamin E and olive oil and no, it does not taste like olive oil. It is cruelty free which is another bonus in my eyes.<br \/><br \/>It was a bit tricky to open though but once you get it it is actually a neat design, instead of twisting it on the bottom you twist it right by the bottom of the cap.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

It's kind of pricy for a lip product but I think that the ingredients are worth it & do make my lips feel more moisturized than they usually are.<br \/><br \/>I side-eyed the price at first but then I look at the ingredients - even as shown on the package I got -  and realize it's worth it.","images":[{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51IwZydb76L._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51IwZydb76L._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51IwZydb76L._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71lzMfnvb8L._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71lzMfnvb8L._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71lzMfnvb8L._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/814X106ty0L._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/814X106ty0L._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/814X106ty0L._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81LUeibG7OL._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81LUeibG7OL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81LUeibG7OL._SL256_.jpg"}],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51IwZydb76L._SL1600_.jpg"}

I'm not sure if I get the same results as I would if I used a traditional toner with cotton. But to be fair, I'm finding as I get older, I don't need the astringent type of toner that I grew up using.

They are not sticky at all, in fact you can't feel them, they are that light weight, yet they are still there when you look in the mirror. I'm even having less trouble with this product getting on my teeth during the day, which with the shape of my mouth has been a long time problem for me. I do try to put on a moisturizing lip balm first, being 50, my lips do tend to get dry and flaky. The tube doesn't scrape off too much as the applicator comes out, leaving just the right amount of product on the end. I love to have on just one thing that has some glitz and these two lighter colors that have that bit of bling to them are just the thing. They are almost the same color, but one is more of a glittery one.

{"text":"Just bought my 2nd pack of 3 tubes so I won\u2019t run out anytime soon\u2026 this is a MIRACLE product for severely chapped lips, and it\u2019s safe for sensitive skin!<br \/><br \/>I have rosacea, and my skin is extremely sensitive. I\u2019ve had to stop wearing cosmetics, and my skin routine has felt like a part time job. I also have several allergies, and the antihistamines I have to take make my skin\/lips even more dry. I\u2019ve apparently become overly sensitized to ingredients in 95%+ of commercial lip balm products, \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients\/products. No matter how much water I drink, very healthy diet, hyaluronic acid supplements & topical hyaluronic acid + occlusives, running a humidifier, staying indoors, etc., nothing has helped the severe, painful peeling of my lips for the past 3-4 years. It\u2019s been embarrassing and has made talking, eating and drinking an uncomfortable and painful.<br \/><br \/>Everything I tried seemed to make this even worse, so I eventually gave up on lip balm. I tried \u201cnothing,\u201d (just to see if I actually needed lip balm- that was a mistake!). I resorted to trying single ingredient options, just to help identify what the problem ingredient might be: testing by applying only straight argan, olive, safflower or squalane oils (messy, shiny, and doesn\u2019t last without an occlusive layer added on top), straight manuka honey (messy, sticky, expensive and only made me want to lick my lips all day lol). Made my own manuka honey, argan oil and beeswax product (worked pretty well but oh so messy, time consuming to make).<br \/><br \/>Finally gave up on that and was only able to use Vanicream ointment (dermatologist recommended and similar to Vaseline but without the petrochemical odor- I can\u2019t use products like Vaseline or Aquaphor FWIW). But even that wasn\u2019t working well because i needed to be SO careful not to apply too much, or the ointment would eventually  migrate onto my face (usually while sleeping), which would cause rosacea flares (heavy occlusives seal in moisture but can also trap in just enough heat to cause a rosacea flare).<br \/><br \/>But that messy solution that only stopped **some** of the peeling temporarily, and never resolved the issue entirely. Even applying every hour on the hour didn\u2019t make much of a difference. My lips were still chapped feeling\/peeling every day, just slightly less chapped.<br \/><br \/>But THIS STUFF IS WHAT ALL LIP BALMS ARE MEANT TO BE! I am not exaggerating when I say that within an hour or so after applying this for the first time, I noticed my lips didn\u2019t feel rough any longer\u2026 for the first time in YEARS!!! Weird, right?!! I didn\u2019t believe it could be possible at first, but it\u2019s truly  like I\u2019ve never had chapped, peeling lips. Miracle in a tube!<br \/><br \/>This must be what Goldilocks looks for when her lips are chapped: It doesn\u2019t burn. It doesn\u2019t sting. It doesn\u2019t taste weird. It\u2019s not too shiny or greasy feeling. It just makes my lips feel smooth and soft. You can faintly taste the elderberry\/manuka honey when applying but it doesn\u2019t linger. It\u2019s not overpowering or flavorful enough to make you inadvertently lick your lips, which I always seem to do with \u201cyummy\u201d lip balm products.<br \/><br \/>It just works. My grad school student son also loves it for the same reasons. It just makes your lips feel and look like lips are supposed to feel and look like.

{"text":"I\u2019ve been using Savannah Bee Co. Tupelo Honey lip balm for a while and it\u2019s the BEST I\u2019ve ever used! But it\u2019s hard for me to find locally, so this was a score! My lips have always gotten severely chapped no matter how much water I drink, no matter what I do. I take medications that make my mouth and skin feel dry, so fighting chapped lips is  a never-ending battle. I\u2019m never without at least one tube of lip balm within arm\u2019s reach!<br \/>I\u2019ve used almost every non-petroleum based \u201cpremium\u201d lip balm out there, and I\u2019ve tried coconut oil, Shea butter, lanolin, you name it. I\u2019ve been settling for Burt\u2019s Bees and Dr. Bronners, both of which feel pretty good but don\u2019t seem to last very long.<br \/>This is the first lip balm I\u2019ve tried in 40+ years that seems to actually work! It goes on much more smoothly, tastes *really* good but isn\u2019t overpowering at all, and actually helps keep my lips soft! Finally!!!<br \/>For anyone wondering, the key lime flavor is really good! I\u2019d never tried it before, but since I love key lime pie, I took a chance. It really does taste like key lime! Not overpowering or artificial tasting and seems to work just as well as the Tupelo honey flavor.<br \/>The seller shipped this quickly, and with a nice personal touch. Thank you so much! I\u2019ll be back soon!","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}
{"text":"I purchased this at my local health food store because I was looking for an all natural\/organic lip balm that was cruelty-free (doesn't test products on animals).  I saw this next to another brand and it was a bigger size for the same price, so I decided to give it a try.  I really love this lip balm.  I live in Florida so the sun (especially in summer time) can blister my lips if they aren't protected.  I also get really chapped lips in the winter from the dry air, so I basically use lip balm year round.  The lip balm goes on silky smooth and smells amazing.  I don't know if it is flavored because I avoid licking my lips, because that just chaps them more and makes the situation worse. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a pain to get the stick to move up when you twist the bottom.  You kind of have to fumble with it for a minute or two and put forth more effort then you need to. Other than that, I love it and have purchased the vanilla chai for my purse and the pomegranate for my desk at work. I just with they had SPF in these lip balms.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

However, when it gets near the end, the last bit seems to break up and fall apart for some reason.

Still, I like it enough to keep using it.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

Tint\/Stain on lips: it does stain lips but it\u2019s fairly temporary again due to its consistency. It\u2019s maybe a 2 or 3 out of 5.<br \/>4. Smell: oh dear lord. It smells awful like chemicals & strong herbs mixed together (I\u2019m not implying that it has chemicals but the smell is just way way off). Definitely 0\/5.<br \/>5.

I rarely use lip balms or blushes but I have noticed a nice pinky hue to natural look makes a big difference.

I will say the benefit of buying the smaller one is the travel size, but it is harder to get a full swipe on the brush to use in one pass. You have to kin of pack it on there a little more to get the desired look. Overall this color combo is fantastic.

I like that it comes in a glass jar (better than plastic), although I also have to say that balm in a jar isn't my favorite. I have nails so whenever I am trying to apply, it gets lodged in between my nails - gross! That said, it isn't a big deal as long as it is good lip balm. I really like the consistency and overall feeling this balm makes my lips feel. It is very moisturizing and kind of just melts on your lips. I am not new to ilapothecary products and have enjoyed some of their products that I've tried. I like the ingredients they use and the whole numerology aspect of it. This is a British brand.

Online lends vast selections with potential skepticism about quality. These were great because they were all unique in scent\/taste of essential oils and yet all the same composition between sticks. I really like Lavender, as it's relaxing and mentally can be a cognitive clearer before bed. The Cinnamon Orange is an excellent combination as I like the combination of smell and flavor. Peppermint a classic scent always enjoyed and like the quality of the oils they use.<br \/><br \/>Ingredients, as listed, are simply Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Beeswax, Vitamin E and essential oils. These are the same types of ingredients I'd used when attempting to craft my own lip balms. It's fun to make them at home and yet with inexpensive prepackaged offerings like this readily available, it becomes unnecessary to create the mess when great ones like this are merely a quick mouse click away.<br \/><br \/>They come in a nice box with all four smells\/flavors (one is totally unscented, just a slight pleasant aroma from the shea butter and almond oil, I really like this one too). It would work nicely as a gift. I like how the different tubes are different colors for the different essential oils used, so I don't have to look and read each one as the composition of materials each look the same (orange doesn't look orange as they don't use extra ingredients) and it's easy to switch between them. As mentioned, I like the cinnamon\/orange or peppermint during the day for the aromatherapeutic benefits and passionate about all things Lavender at nighttime.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

I have literally tried every lip gloss you can buy at the store searching for one that worked for me. I cannot wear any with sunscreen (or chemicals) in it, they make my lips drier. I used to use EOS, then I realised that they made my lips drier also. I must be allergic to something in the EOS brand. But these work great, 24 hours later my dry peeling lips are nice and moisturized.  I really cannot express how much i love this brand. And  It's organic and fair trade. I really like how all of the ingredients are actual things and not chemicals. I like the vanilla but they accidentally sent me blood orange, i could not be happier, that was a happy accident. I really like the blood orange which happen to be very close in color the the vanilla.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

{"text":"These are not wildly moisturizing but they are pleasant and I don't mind reapplying.

{"text":"So I bought these lip balm containers about a year ago and because of either laziness or trepidation (really it was the latter) it took me this long to create a label for them. I used canva to create the label, printed it on vinyl sticker paper and a cricut machine to cut it once it was printed. It sounds easy peezy right? No! The SIZE of the tube was the problem! No matter how many you tube videos I watched nobody had this size tube and I went through I don't know how many pages (plain paper, mind you) printing out a sample until I got the measurements right. So for those of you who want to do the same (yes I am selling lip balm and needed a label for retail) the correct measurement is 1.6x2.0... the height will give you just enough room to clear both the top and the turn circle (or whatever its called) at the bottom. The width however is just shy of touching. you can even expand it to 2.1 if you want your label to overlap.<br \/>Overall I like the tubes, I haven't had any problem with them other than the fact that they are truly small, but they're sturdy and have very little leakage, they are a good deal for the price.<br \/>But remember, if you're selling your lip balms or just want to pretty it up with a label, the measurements are 1.6x2.0.<br \/>Enjoy!","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

{"text":"I just received the rose scented chapstick and I must say that it smells awful. Doesn\u2019t smell like rose AT ALL. I read the ingredients and realized that this has retinal palmitate (vitamin a). I\u2019ve been warned by my dermatologist to avoid retinol in the sun. The EWG warns against Retin Palminate specifically. I thought this was going to be a stellar product as it was endorsed by Gin Amber. She said it smells lovely so I wonder if this product is a knock off. If you\u2019re curious about retinal under sun exposure just google it yourself or ask your dermatologist. As for me I won\u2019t be using this during the day. Super disappointed.<br \/><br \/>The only good things about the product are that it does feel nice, it doesn\u2019t taste bad and if you\u2019re looking for anti-aging the retinol is good for that. So for me it\u2019s a 50\/50 overall. Really wish it actually smelled nice.<br \/><br \/>I will add that I generally really like Camille Beckham products. I used to work in a hospital and handled paper all day. It sucked the moisture right out of my skin and those products were the ONLY thing that saved my hands. Everyone in the office kept trying to take my lotion. So while I feel let down my this particular product I still like other items.","images":[],"sentiment":"neutral","image_url":null}

Yeouth Organic Vanilla Lip Balm has a wonderful vanilla(my personal favorite) scent.  When you apply it it feels very smooth and soft, not at all waxy.  My lips feel very hydrated.  My kids also like the feel of it on their lips. It does not have a flavor that I noticed.  I also love that we are a family of five so there is one for each of us.

I read the box, it said to shake contents before using, so I did for a few minutes and then applied it.<br \/>It was like applying paste, which is apparently what &#34;waterproof&#34; means to the seller.

Oh my GOSH! I looked it up on the internet to see that this is very common with this brand. Last week, I bought one for my very sickly grandmother because she always had commented on wanting to try it when she saw the commercials on tv. I feel bad having to take it back.

{"text":"Manuka honey elderberry is my very favorite lip balm. Both are antiviral so, as a cold sore sufferer, this has been key for me. I nibble on my lips when I\u2019m stressed, and the subsequent dry and broken skin often triggers an eruption. The corners of my mouth sometimes get really irritated, caused by something as simple as wearing dark lipstick. This balm heals skin unbelievably fast. I coat my lips before bed and it has worked wonders for prevention of issues. Worth its weight in gold. Thank you for auto-delivery.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019ll also mention I tried the mint one and, while it was ok, it lacked the special quality of the manuka elderberry. I also felt the mint wasn\u2019t strong enough.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

{"text":"I'm torn about this mask. It moisturizes pretty well and gives a nice shine if you use it like a gloss, but I was a bit put-off by the fact that it didn't have a safety seal. It came in an unsealed box (the Amazon package was sealed, of course, but the actual box the tube was in wasn't taped or sealed in any way) and the lid didn't have any shrink-wrap, or foil strip, or even tape.<br \/><br \/>I'm not a big fan of scents, and while this one is not bad, it's not great either. It's a little on the strong side for my tastes.<br \/><br \/>Speaking of tastes, this gloss\/mask has a bit of an oily\/greasy taste. It's not bad, but doesn't match the smell of it. I don't mind it, but I thought I'd mention it since it's important to some people.<br \/><br \/>All that said, it moisturizes pretty well and I like the way my lips feel in the morning, which is saying a lot.

{"text":"I am fair skinned and often burn, even in the winter. My family jokes that I'm the only person they know who ends up with a sunburn on Thanksgiving and Christmas living in zone 6A. It's sad, but true. And if you've ever had sunburned lips, you know it's something you don't want a repeat of. Blisters and cracking are terrible, but on your delicate lips they make speaking and eating torture.<br \/><br \/>I'm quite pleased with these so far. Panama Jack is a great brand and known for their sun care products. The lip balm is excellent. It has a broad spectrum of sunscreen included, the scents are great and tropical, it goes on feeling smooth and moist, and it lasts! It need reapplied every two hours or every 80 minutes if you're in water, but it definitely helps! I can feel it on my lips, although it goes on smooth and soft, and I know it's working to keep me from getting burned. Honestly, I'm not sensitive to any of the ingredients and in a pinch, it's even great to put on my nose to protect it in the harsh winter, but sunny conditions here.<br \/><br \/>The multi pack was an awesome value. Seven balms cost less than getting three or four separately. My only negative was that the lid on my mango was busted, but it is still moist and I used an old balm lid to make sure it didn't dry out. I'll definitely get more of these. They don't really have a taste, but they smell amazing. They're clear to white in color and don't deposit any color or stain on my lips.<br \/><br \/>Reputable brand and skin protection!

All but one turns a really orange color and I have pale skin with pink undertones so it should not do that. One has a horrible crayon\/wax smell but the other 5 didn't have much smell, to me. The one color that I do like is a burgundy (the tube is more brown) but it will stain the skin around your lips bc it doesn't stay put.

{"text":"These work great at keeping my lips smooth and soft. I lick my lips a lot which in turn leaves them dried out often, this does a good job of replenishing the moisture to them. I also like to wear matte lipsticks which are notorious for dehydrating the lips and this counteracts that, in fact I even wear a light coating of this under my lipsticks. I like that this doesn't have an overly greasy texture or appearance when applied. It only gives a slight glisten to the lips and it's not too thick.<br \/><br \/>The smell is kind of herbal or maybe slightly minty but it's very light and not noticeable. It does eventually go away after application if you happen to not be a fan of the scent. It doesn't have any disgusting taste either, which was a huge plus.<br \/><br \/>I think these lips balms are a great value, it comes with 2 and the containers are huge. I don't think I've seen any lip balms in this large of a container. Best of all, the ingredients are all natural and petroleum free.<br \/><br \/>The only complaint I had is that it's fairly hard, I have to use my nail to break it up and scrape a small chunk out. It melts on your lips and applies easily once it's out but it's kind of a pain getting out the container. You COULD just rub your finger across the top but that took forever since I would only get a small amount that way.<br \/><br \/>Overall I am pleased with the quality and amount of these lip balms. I would absolutely purchase this brand again in the future.<br \/><br \/>I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I was in no way compensated and have no incentive to leave either a positive or negative review. These are my personal thoughts and opinions on this product. I try to answer all the questions I'd like to know as a shopper.

I was really hoping for a sweet, creamy, &#34;horchata&#34; smell, (since it does say &#34;sweet&#34; & &#34;horchata&#34;) but instead it is has a VERY strong cinnamon smell. My first thought was that I was chewing into a Big Red stick of gum. So if you like Big Red gum then this is basically a lip balm version of that. I do like the way it makes my lips feel tho. I get really bad chapped lips in the cold winter time, and this has helped keep my lips moisturized and soft. Its not too greasy, and its not too dry either (like burts bees), and the cinnamon gives it a very slight tingle where you can tell and feel like its sort of plumping your lips. I don't find myself applying it that often which is good because that means it stays on my lips for a long period of time. If it was a dollar cheaper i'd buy this all the time, the quality is there, but I cant get over the over powering smell of cinnamon.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

I keep lip balm in my purse, at my desk, next to the bed, etc.<br \/><br \/>The quantity of the balm is very large, and the quality is excellent. Sometimes with other lip balms they can get grainy and melty when you get to the end of the tube, and it ruins it. So far this balm doesn't seem to do to that and I've been using it daily for 1.5 months so far.<br \/><br \/>The vanilla scent is fine but the pear scent is absolutely divine.

{"text":"These come in a small box with a pack of 12 empty lip balm containers. I ordered the purple ones. The actual shaft of the lip balm is clear with the twister and the cap being purple. I made a mixture of my own essential oils of peppermint and lavender and then added up a mix with shea butter, coconut oil, beeswax , color and warmed it up. I used a pipette to fill it into the containers. This was very easy to do. You have to make sure you fill them while it is warm enough to pipe. I just filled it right up to the top and then if it isn't just the way you want it you can twist the bottom up until its just right at the top. At the end I only had enough to fill 3\/4 of one so I just twisted it until it sat nicely right at the brim of the lip at the top. I just capped them and I popped them in the fridge to set. Easy process and no leaking. This is so easy that I probably will never buy chapstick again I can just make it. Looking forward to trying different combinations of oils colors and flavors. I received a discount in exchange for an honest review.","images":[{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Ei5XzBs6L.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Ei5XzBs6L._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Ei5XzBs6L._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71fAvrmCV9L.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71fAvrmCV9L._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71fAvrmCV9L._SL256_.jpg"}],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71Ei5XzBs6L.jpg"}

{"text":"Extremely happy with this Shea Butter. For the size of both bottles along with the price you can\u2019t beat it. This was exactly what I was looking for when making my own body lotions. Since I make my own and go through it pretty quickly I needed a Shea Butter that I would be able to use from again and again. I had ordered smaller bottle type jugs in the past and have gone through them on my first or second batch, having to re-order them frequently and also spending a lot of money on them. With this one I was able to scoop about 2 cups worth of one of the bottles and I still have plenty left over not only in the bottle I\u2019ve used from but I still have the other bottle left! I definitely recommend purchasing this if you make your own lotions, etc (for personal use) because you will have a lot left over to make more batches and you won\u2019t end up spending a ton of money on it!","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

{"text":"(Ingredients list is at the bottom of this review.)<br \/><br \/>I'm so glad I ordered the Frankies Bikinis Lip Butter Gloss in Lilikoi. It's a really nice, smooth, emollient, buttery lip gloss\/balm with decent staying power. It lasts on the lips, and doesn't require too frequent re-application. It also has a comfortable, smooth slip to it, and it is not sticky. The balm is yellow, but it goes on sheer. It doesn't look tinted on the lips.<br \/><br \/>The flavor is lilikoi, which is apparently another way of saying passion fruit. I'm not usually keen on passion fruit flavor, but this one is surprisingly nice. The flavor\/scent is sweet and pleasantly fruity. Like a sweet, very lightly floral-perfumed fruit. It's really nice, and not at all off-putting or overpowering.<br \/><br \/>The packaging is excellent. The graphics and colors are beautiful. I also really like how the applicator is dome-shaped, with no sharp edges or openings to damage the lips. It makes it very easy to squeeze out the lip balm and apply it quickly. The formula and applicator also makes it difficult to squeeze out more than you intended, and that's important. I have found that feature lacking in some other lip products, and I've wasted a lot of product unnecessarily.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I'm really happy to have this lip gloss\/balm, and I will continue using it. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice glossy lip balm to try.<br \/><br \/>INGREDIENTS:<br \/><br \/>Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Rhus Verniciflua Peel Wax, Rhus Succedanea Fruit Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Natural Flavor, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tribehenin, Sorbitan Isostearate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Oil, Monoammonium Glycyrrhizinate, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Carmine, Tin Oxide.","images":[{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716qTBp3+tL._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716qTBp3+tL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716qTBp3+tL._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/717M1IftogL._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/717M1IftogL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/717M1IftogL._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7194rgZJ-hL._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7194rgZJ-hL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/7194rgZJ-hL._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71eXNBJiOEL._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71eXNBJiOEL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71eXNBJiOEL._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71wXJAVRqPL._SL1600_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71wXJAVRqPL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71wXJAVRqPL._SL256_.jpg"}],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/716qTBp3+tL._SL1600_.jpg"}

Also, I like the touch of menthol\/mint as it has a cooling effect\/soothes my lips.

It does not make my face oily or dry either. It seems to have the perfect balance for your face. It also dries quickly after spraying it.

Have hated some and I haven't loved any of them a lot. Started doing aromatherapy last April. Took two online courses from a reputable aromatherapy company--Natural Living and Butters & Balms. Started making a lot of my skincare products. Even made some of my own herb infused oils as a base for my homemade lip balms and oils. Hadn't love any of those, either. Actually took everything and added beeswax to it to make my own &#34;Healing Lip Balm.&#34; I like it a lot, but will never be able to replicate it:)<br \/><br \/>I had recently bought a natural lip balm that I just loved; however, it didn't have an SPF factor. When I saw the Cal Pharma SPF 30 Mango Lip Balm at a discount for an honest review, I thought I'd try it. I must not have looked at the ingredients when I ordered it (which is VERY unusual for me) because I would have noticed the active ingredients:  Avobenzone 3 %, Homosalate 7.5%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 2.75%, Oxybenzone 6%. I have sensitive, allergic, reactive, rosacea skin and am allergic to most commercial sunscreens. In addition to these ingredients, the SPF 30 Mango Lip Balm contains Undecylcrylene Dimethicone. The only one of these chemicals that I could confirm was natural was the Homosalate. Not sure how they call this a natural product. My only excuse is that I'm going to Florida in a few weeks to visit my mother and wanted a lip balm with an SPF factor.<br \/><br \/>Aside from the issue with the chemicals, I've tried this a few times. For one, the texture is very waxy--too much beeswax. I also feel a tingle on my lips and an itch in my throat, so suspect I'm having an allergic reaction to the SPF 30 Mango Lip Balm. This product is not for me. If you don't have allergic\/sensitive skin, and don't care as much about ingredients, this product might be for you. Your other choice is physical blockers--like zinc or titanium oxide. And they give you that whitish cast. Not real desirable, either.<br \/><br \/>I did receive a discount on this product with the expectation that I provide an honest review. This has no bearing on my rating and I review all products as if I had paid full price. My opinions are from my own personal experience with the product and I have no affiliation with the seller.","images":[],"sentiment":"negative","image_url":null}

{"text":"This is a great product for someone that doesn't need a ton of makeup (i.e. is youngish, or is embracing their age and doesn't feel the need to cover up much)... I found all of the products in this palette to be wonderful for my skin, glowy, colorful, beautiful bronze. It made me want to purchase different shades for the cheek tints (I use these mostly for cheek and less for lip, but do occasionally layer with other products on the lips). The luminizer is the only product that comes across as \"makeup\" as it does have a bit of sparkle (not glitter- but definitely a bit of sheen from the mica). I love the uncoverup as well, and between that and this palette- is all I'm using for my day to day makeup.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

I just take a little and warm it in my hands. Some people warm it in the microwave or add other oils to it. So you can experiment with how best to use it for yourself.

The case is pretty, with a peachy body and a wood-grain lid. It's easy to open and roll up. I keep the balm rolled back down after use to avoid smushing it up with a poorly aimed replacement of the lid. The balm itself is soft and smells and tastes good. It makes your lips shine and feel protected and healthy. If you have severely chapped lips, this particular product is probably not so useful (a medicated lip cream would be a better treatment), but if your lips are just dry and feel need protection, this is perfect. All the ingredients are natural, and the actual quantity seems bigger than the usual lip care product, so it may last longer, depending on how often you use it. I can recommend this with no hesitation. I will buy it again and will try out the other \"flavors\" too. I hate for my lips to be chapped, and winter is right around the bend!","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

This palette is a must-have for any woman.  Seriously... all I need is the RMS 11 &#34;un-cover&#34; up and this palette plus mascara.  I actually got rid of all my other makeup and only have these two items now (plus mascara), which I can take everywhere.  P.S.

{"text":"Usually, by this time of the year (late October), my lips are already chapped.  Thanks to Hudson and James Cloud Lip Balm my lips are still looking, and feeling, great.  I received the balm inside a short, round, 0.5-ounce glass jar.  It came tightly sealed inside a form-fitting bubble-wrapped envelope.  There was a tiny, round transparent protective seal on the jar and its large black lid.  The seal is not very effective.  I was able to easily open the cap without realizing the seal was there.  The print on the jar is very tiny.  After looking at the jar several times with a magnifying glass, I couldn't locate an expiration or a best by date.  Many hygiene product don't have them but they should.  These dates let me know if the ingredient are still fresh.<br \/><br \/>I use the Cloud Lip Balm twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.  The balm feels nice on my lips.  It is very easy to smooth all over my lips.  It reminds me of some expensive high-end lip butter that I once owned.  The jar is small enough to fit inside the pockets of my jeans.  During the day, I use Carmex Classic Lip Balm when necessary.  The Cloud Lip and the Carmex are working together well to protect my lips and to keep them appearing healthy and attractive.  I've been faithfully using the Cloud Lip Balm for nearly three weeks and have not experienced any adverse side effects or allergic reactions.  It doesn't have a noticeable scent.  Also, I would like to note that the balm has a light-yellow waxy color whereas Amazon's website shows it to have a creamy white color.<br \/><br \/>The Hudson and James Cloud Lip Balm doesn't sting or burn my lips after applying it; I hardly notice that it is there.  What I do notice is that my lips are feeling and looking great despite the change in seasons.  I wish I knew the price of the lip balm.  At the time of this review, it wasn't available for purchase.  Overall, I like this hygiene product and would strongly recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry, chapped lips.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

Takes some work to wash off. Finishes with a green tea scent and refreshed.<br \/><br \/>FACE MOISTURIZER: Has a tea\/alcohol scent at first...Goes on smooth.

Does a decent job.<br \/><br \/>LIP BALM: Awesome balm!!! At first I thought it was an odd addition to the set. But man I love this balm. Goes on with a hint of sweet tea.

{"text":"I've tried a few other products by Hudson and James so I was intrigued by this. I've made a lot of beauty products at home so I'm very familiar with the ingredients. Going into the winter in New England, I need some good lip balms. This feels nice on the lips. Has a very mild orange scent, but nothing artificial. Not sticky at all and I like that it's in a glass jar. I was surprised by the term \"cloud\" in the name since this was hard and dense. Depending on the temperatures of your climate, both cocoa and shea harden up quite a lot but will melt at certain higher temperatures. Shea butter is easy to whip but this seems like it was just melted down and poured. I thought it would be more fluffy. I like that the ingredients are organic and fair trade but I still can't seem to justify the cost.  Shea butter, sweet orange essential oil and cocoa seed butter are some of the most affordable oils and butter so twenty bucks for this seems very high. I'll use it up but it's not a stand out product for me.","images":[],"sentiment":"neutral","image_url":null}

I see other reviews compare it to floor cleaner but I like the scent\u2014the reason people may think that is the pine scent may remind some of some types of floor cleaner, but for me it is a fresh woodsy-pine-scent.<br \/><br \/>The facial scrub has tiny beads in it. The scent isn\u2019t quite as apparent in the scrub as it is in the shampoo\/body wash. It does have an exfoliating quality to it.<br \/><br \/>The moisturizer is unscented. It\u2019s a light moisturizer. It\u2019d be good for my guy in winter when our air is particularly dry.<br \/><br \/>I like the lip balm a lot. It\u2019s very emollient and feels super good going on (I tried it!) It has a cool refreshing feel to it after you apply it. Really nice lip balm.<br \/><br \/>I think my bf will like this set a lot to try out using specialized skin care products instead of just using soap on his face and go.<br \/><br \/>Rugged & Dapper is a little on the pricy side for someone who\u2019s doesn\u2019t follow a skin-care regime so I don\u2019t know that he\u2019d purchase these items again; however, the price isn\u2019t all that bad for someone who does regularly use specialty skin-care products.<br \/><br \/>He\u2019ll enjoy this set, but if he does not like something, I\u2019ll come back to report that here.<br \/><br \/>I hope my review helped you today.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

{"text":"I really wanted to love this; I've been trying to radically reduce my waste and simultaneously use more natural products, and this seemed like such a perfect fit. I didn't mind the small size at all; that was part of my goal.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, both the pink & red lip\/cheek colors make my cheeks break out, and the pink is too drying and patchy on my lips (I'm over 35, so it's possible this will work better for younger skin). The red works nicely for lip coloring on initial application and isn't drying, but it bleeds badly after wearing it for any real length of time, and then you start to have fruit-punch mouth.<br \/><br \/>The lip balm at bottom may well be the worst part. It is simultaneously not moisturizing (feels like more of a gloss than a balm) and it half-melts in even the slightest warmth, so every time I touch it I get a giant gob of it.<br \/><br \/>The highlight and bronzer might work well for younger skin, but they are very glittery. For me, I would only use these on my eyes, where they slide around horribly (even with primer). They are gorgeous in color, but just not a good fit for me, and possibly not for anyone over 35.","images":[],"sentiment":"negative","image_url":null}

{"text":"I used these for a stick of the extremely inexpensive ARKO shaving soap, and it worked so well that I\u2019ve been using it much more than the rest of my soaps.<br \/>To see if it would hold up, I didn\u2019t even try to unwrap it, I just jammed the stick of ARKO on to the center spike in the container. It worked just fine, but I imagine constantly doing that would diminish the life of the container.<br \/>I jammed a second one into a different container after removing just the paper from the bottom of the stick and it worked a treat, sliding on very easily.<br \/>I have had these sticks of ARKO for years and rarely used stick soap before as it was a bit difficult to hang on to the stick while rubbing it on my wet face, the sticks were just too slick to easily hold on to, even when wrapped in paper. It was easier wetting my brush, rubbing it on the soap (difficult when it\u2019s just a stick) and lathering away, but this has REALLY made sticks easier to use.<br \/>I also grated one of my other puck soaps up and pressed it in to one of these containers. It worked well and I intend to use it for traveling.

{"text":"I am so glad that I got this set. I have been wanting to get a hydrating facial mist, but the one I want to get costs just too much. This bottle is  60 ml, very portable, easy to carry in purse, and it comes with a lip balm that smells awesome and works great on lips. This is a must have if you travel a lot, especially on the flight where the air always dries out my skin and hair. This mist works so well, and gives me instant moisture boost on my face and hair. I can't travel with them in my purse. Since I have them in my purse all the time, my face is well hydrated and it doesn't mess up my make up. Awesome!<br \/><br \/>If I have to suggest one thing, it will be the package. The product itself is very nice, but the bottle label is very simple and doesn't look appealing to me. If I was the manufacture, I will make a better label for the product, since it deserves a nice label to show how good it is.<br \/><br \/>I got this set at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

Immediately after putting it on it feels great but soon, maybe 10 minutes later, your lips feel dried out with a sticky residue. The color is sort of a gross orangey pink.

It doesn't feel harsh (I use it on occasion only) and I can control how hard I rub and for how long, thus ensuring my lips aren't raw at the end.  The cotton candy leaves a pleasant taste on my lips when I am done and with organic ingredients, I don't feel guilty.  The hardest part is not trying to just lick my lips clean and instead use a wipe to remove this!","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

I don't mind bringing it out to use if it lasted only 15 minutes because I know this lip balm will last me at least half the year.

I immediately knew it had to be from the lip balm because it happened way too close in time of me putting it on. I checked the small print on the sticks and they're from 2018- Making them EXPIRED and probably holding loads of bacteria. I woke up today and the lumps still aren't gone, as far as I know the lumps are normal occurences from using expired lip balm, but PLEASE do not buy these.","images":[],"sentiment":"negative","image_url":null}

To fill, we cut the tip off of a pipette and attached it to the syringe.  That allowed us to fill from the bottom of the tube.  Without the pipette, just using the syringe, there was a lot of air left in the bottom of the tube. Or a lot of air bubbles.  It became very messy.

One time I ordered this (but not from the same seller) and it arrived with a broken cap. This came 2 days before the expected date and I love it so much. The 32 oz is definitely worth it all.

I find that I only have to apply 1-2 times a day and I wear masks at work all day.  The flavor is very mild as well, and not tasty enough to make me want to lick it off.

And there is no picture that shows the ingredients as listed on the tube (this should be corrected). Even the video in the reviews is unfocused when it shows the ingredients.

A cute little round circle instead of a cylindrical, where you do not have to touch your finger to your lips (for those who can be a bit of a germophobe, like myself), and a product that smells so sweet. It seriously reminds me of starbursts. But this lip balm doesn't work for me. I saw my sisters use it, and I had to have one. It's totally unique, so luckily my older sister bought me one (actually two, at different times). I gave it two tries with pomegranate raspberry and honeysuckle honeydew, and they both made my lips break out. It was a disaster, and I do not know what ingredient in this that gives me a reaction, for this is supossed to be organic. The first time I just stopped using it and my lips went back to the way they were to be. But the second time I actually had to apply a mixture of over the counter medication in order to releave I guess you can call it a rash. It was just bumpy and no good.

{"text":"I love all things RMS Beauty. Unlike most makeup, my skin responds very well to their products. The colors are pretty and subtle, and their highlighters\/luminizers are by far the best I've ever tried. If you want to use something that feels natural and nourishing, I highly recommend going with RMS Beauty! I get so many compliments when I wear their makeup, and people often say I look like I'm &#34;glowing.&#34; No complaints! For first-time users, it's probably important to note that the colors are sheerer than &#34;typical&#34; makeup, but the pigment can be reasonable intensified by adding more to build the color. Also, I have yet to experience an unflattering color by them, and I have skin that's prone to looking a bit yellow with the wrong shade.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

The ingredients are olive oil, beeswax,coconut oil,jojoba oil, natural flavor, shea butter, stevia leaf extract, sunflower seed oil, honeydew melon seed extract, honeysuckle flower extract, limonene, linalool.

For years my lips have peeled every morning until they bled....so sick of it and so desperate to find something that would help.  This stuff is incredible.  You put it on and 5 minutes later your lips are moist and soft.  I put it on before I go to bed and then put it on while I'm brushing my teeth.  I apply it up over the lip line and then after brushing and flossing, I wipe it off and apply my lip liner and lipstick.  Voila!  Gorgeous lips!  I have searched for years for something with these ingredients and that was pure...no chemicals.  It really glides on beautifully and for once in my life does not leave my lips in worse condition than when I started.

The actual balm is smooth and moisturizing, it feels lovely on the lips. It goes on clear and then changes color to a pinky-red color. Once the lips dry (when the product dries on the lips) the color stays! I was able to eat and drink freely and still have a lovely pop of color. I will absolutely be using this often from now!","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

I found the Moroccan Magic by accident and will never use any other.  My lips are soft and smooth this winter.

But, if this product only works on lips that are primarily healthy it's useless and definitely not worth $35.

{"text":"I had really high hopes for this product, but was left VERY DISAPPOINTED. First of all, some background::<br \/><br \/>My go-to lip balm of choice is a CBD infused balm from a company called 'Nature's Root'. THAT product is the ABSOLUTE BEST I've ever used. Not only does it last long, but it ACTIVELY HEALS my lips. The downside is that the Nature's Root balm is not exactly cheap; it's the same price as this 'Merry Hempsters' brand more or less. What makes the Nature's Root lip balm so expensive is the shipping: $25.00 shipping fee. So if I buy three $7.00 Nature's Root lip balm, I get charged a 25.00 shipping fee. If I only buy ONE, I still get charged the 25.00 shipping fee. Unfortunately I don't have that kind of cash to dole out all the time, so I am currently on the hunt for a suitable replacement.<br \/><br \/>That's where this product, 'Merry Hempsters' comes in. I purchased the 2 pack Spearmint flavor, because it was the closest thing this company offered to the 'Nature's Root' product I use.  Now first let me say that I am ABSOLUTELY AWARE that there is a big difference between CBD and hemp. I understand that hemp will NOT have the same healing and pain relief qualities as CBD, but I had hoped this product would still be a good balm to try. The reviews here all seem pretty good, and as a bonus, the company promised to include a free powdered drink mix with my purchase of lip balm.<br \/><br \/>Long story short...THEY LIED.<br \/><br \/>My 2 lip balm tubes came haphazardly wrapped in clear, thin bubble wrap. There was NO drink mix included. Now, I'm not really a fan of pre-sweetened, powdered drinks anyway, but the fact that I was promised this and did not receive still annoys me. For me, the best way to test a new lip balm is to take my toothbrush, add a small dot of toothpaste, and gently brush my lips to exfoliate them. This way, you don't have any leftover film or residue from your previous lip balm, gloss, or lipstick (or food), and will be able to better gauge the quality of the new balm. Afterwards, I rinsed my lips, patted the excess water away with a baby-wipe, and applied the balm. This product is VERY waxy and basically just sits on top of your lips. A good quality lip balm (to me) goes on creamy, helped by your body's natural heat, and absorbs into your lips. Your lips should feel moist, soft and supple without feeling sticky, (tacky) or dry.<br \/><br \/>This product did not do that.<br \/><br \/>It had a waxy, slightly greasy feel and did not seem to moisturize at all. In fact, it actually made my lips MORE chapped, and I found myself having to reapply this stuff MULTIPLE TIMES within the hour. As a result, I went through that first tub in a matter of DAYS. THIS IS NOT OKAY. To make matters worse, as I neared the bottom of the tube, the remaining balm began BREAKING APART AND CRUMBLING. I have NEVER had that happen before.<br \/><br \/>In all, I would NOT recommend this product. The company did NOT include the free drink mix AS PROMISED, and the product itself made my lips even MORE chapped. There is also absolutely NO HEALING factor included, despite the fact that the ingredients list looks nice. I wish I had saved my money.","images":[],"sentiment":"negative","image_url":null}

{"text":"My favorite lip balms were Burts bees. Unfortunately, I am allergic to topical soy. And Burts bees uses it in all of their lip products. A number of places do. So I\u2019ve been searching for replacements.<br \/><br \/>These work. They do a great job of moisturizing, the colors are not muddy which I find with a lot of natural products the colors aren\u2019t pure or they\u2019re always very brown toned which does not look good on me. But the colors aren\u2019t real colorful. They aren\u2019t deeply pigmented. I prefer to use a tinted lip balm than a lipstick, but I need a little color. And the shimmer wasn\u2019t very shimmery.<br \/><br \/>But if you don\u2019t like a lot of color these are really great. They\u2019re not hard, and they are not greasy and slippery and sticky. They are spot on for lip balms. As I\u2019ve said I\u2019ve been looking, and some of them I\u2019ve tried are really greasy and slimy. These are not \u2014 they are very good balms, just not as pigmented as I would like.<br \/><br \/>By the way, my lips and my skin our dryer. Even so I don\u2019t like to slather things on.

For the price of five tubes of Burt's Bees, I was able to purchase 50, and this lip balm is every bit as natural and of a similar, if not higher, quality.<br \/><br \/>I would also like to commend this company for its excellent customer service: I had initially received lip balm that was the wrong flavor and in the wrong color tubes. I emailed the company, and a representative responded within an hour, telling me I should feel free to keep the product they sent me, and they would quickly send the correct product.

These are 1\/16th inch shorter than the 2 3\/8 long ones I used before.  And there's a teeny difference in the opening I can't even measure, but it's enough to cause them to not fit in my  rack.  I managed to get most in by tapping with a hammer, but of course destroyed several along the way.  My old ones just pop in and hold nicely when I flip it over.<br \/><br \/>Of course I'd looked all over for natural colored ones which were &#34;standard&#34; and couldn't find any, so settled on these thinking, well, at least they will fit in my rack...","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

{"text":"I am a fan of this lip balm...the low-profile case fits in a pocket quite well and is much handier than other brands. I ride a motorcycle and balm is important as the constant wind (with an open face helmet) causes lips to dry very quickly. Being on a bike, you don't want a lot of bulky things to carry, so this slim balm is just great. Being able to get this many for this cheap was just great...almost 'too good to be true'.<br \/><br \/>However...t tried a few different ones from different parts of the box I received and each one has a terrible smell and worse taste (I know it isn't edible, but you do occasionally get a little in your mouth). You can detect a hint of the mint\/wax scent I am used to from this product, but there is an overwhelming odor of cardboard soaked in vomit. It's awful. The entire box is unusable. If you think odor isn't important, just remember that your lips tend to be a bit close to your nose...you smell it CONSTANTLY. I'm guessing these were all so cheap because they were stored improperly or in a place they were able to absorb odor from something quite foul. I am VERY disappointed and will never buy this in bulk again...turns out it really was too good to be true.","images":[],"sentiment":"negative","image_url":null}

I store it in tupperware under my sink and rub between my hands to soften up before applying to my skin.  I've used it on my son's eczema and he loves how it feels.

I will get chap stick for my son. He is sixteen and certainly does not want to walk around with cherry lip balm even if he needs it, LOL. This looks very manly and no man would be ashamed to be carrying it. Honestly, aside from the more manly design, I really love that it is flat! He can keep it in his pocket, I want lip balm I can keep in my pocket. I actually do keep lip balm in my pocket but it is way obvious. Well the thought that my son would love the lip balm went out the window as soon as my husband saw it. He snatched it up and has been using it since we got it. Great addition to the product!

I think I have enough with this pack to last me a very long time, and that is a good thing.  My lips feel very hydrated, and the added sun protection for every bit of my skin is a huge deal.  These are great for a beach day, or even for those chapped lips that often happen on dry winters days, which are approaching for you northerners. I know because I lived in Canada for 22 years.

{"text":"So it's very pretty packaging and it does exactly what it says it does. It's a clear yellowish orange jelly balm with gold shimmer that turns a bright pink for me after a few seconds. It has a pleasant makeup smell but it does have a bitter taste, but then again you aren't supposed to lick or eat it.<br \/><br \/>I was a little concerned because it did kind of have a tingley burn sensation for me almost immediately, but I guess that could be something to plump up your lips?

{"text":"First off the positive about these lipsticks. They arrived fast and well packed. They come individually wrap in a box. Simple slick container, the colors are beautiful. It applies on smooth and very long lasting. Had it on for 9 hours never touched up even after drinking or eating. Love that these lipsticks do not dry my lips or make them look cracked like others do. Down side and my reason for three stars, the dot sticker on the box or the container doesn't match the actual color of the lipstick. You will have to open each one of them to see the real color. Also they are about to expire. I got them on December 18, 2020 and as you can see in the pictures they expire on August 14, 2021. Only 8 months to use them all before expiration.

{"text":"As a lip balm aficionado for many years, I finally found the perfect lip balm! What sets it apart is how deeply moisturizing & softening it is. It isn't waxy, like Burt's Bees for example, which creates a heavy coating on your lips but, for me, doesn't do anything long-term. This isn't the type of lip balm that your lips get \"addicted\" to, where you need more and more coats. In fact, many lip balms I've used end up being more drying than anything. Dr. Bronners lip balm isn't just managing my dry lips, but actually improving them! My lips get so dry that they get little scales that I need to exfoliate away, but after a day or two of using this lip balm the scales go away and my lips become soft again. I also love how the balm gives a little shine and the ginger plumps them up just a tiny bit. I'm obsessed &lt;3","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}
{"text":"This was great for the lack of harsh chemicals, however I found it to not be very moisturizing. I have dry skin & lips, to be fair. I got a little tired of the smell, but also use another product from this company with the same smell, which could be a contributing factor. Additionally, my sense of smell is extremely keen. The color wasn\u2019t quite as much as I\u2019d like, but I wouldn\u2019t rule out trying this product if you are looking for a natural lip balm.","images":[],"sentiment":"neutral","image_url":null}

{"text":"I have a ton of these Revo\/Chap-Ice push-up lip balms, and I love almost all all of the flavors. Watermelon is an exception\u2014it's not my bag, but that's just my personal opinion. The strawberry and cherry are delicious. The former tastes like a mixture of a soft, sweet, ripe strawberry and a strawberry ice cream treat. The latter smells just like a cherry slushee or popsicle in the summertime.<br \/><br \/>My major issue with this set is price. Three 0.14 oz Revo lip balms should cost a customer no more than $3.00. I've gotten six-packs of these EXACT styles of Revo push-up mini balms at Target for $4.99, and they even included a coupon for $1.00 off my next purchase! Therefore, each mini balm on its own should cost no more than $1.00, and if offered in a combo pack, should include a discount.

{"text":"I think that ever since Miley's promotion of the eos in the 'we can't stop' video, these spherical lip balms are flying off the shelves! I have to say I'm in love with these bad boys.<br \/> First of all the shape. Most lip balms come in tubes or \"Chapstick form\" but the shape of these remind me of me ECCENTRIC and I freakin love it. Easy to find in your usually cluttered pocketbook. The shape makes it easier to apply and it's super cute.<br \/> This was the second one I bought after buying the medicated tangerine and I also have the blueberry acai, but the next one I'll buy is the pomegranate raspberry and I hope to collect all of them. The honeydew homeysuckle smells AMAZING and it makes my lips super soft, taste great(don't judge me lol) and I just love it. They can get pretty pricey my best advice for any buyers is to go to walgreens or cvs sometimes they're on sale 2\/$6 so you save a little money. But I'm totally obsessed and I have am abundance of lip balms. Eos will be my next collection! Happy buying !!!!","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

Bee Bella's lip balms are not only batch made of the finest organic, fair trade and cruelty free ingredients (immensely important to me), they are incredibly smooth and lovely on. And! As an added bonus, a portion of all the profits goes to bee research and saving the bees!","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but this is a new one for me.  This is my first time ordering these products.  I opened box yesterday and found that both containers' lids were cracked and broken apart inside the bag.  Funny enough, the box had air cushions, but the shea butter was set to the side of the box. If someone was rough with the package with that particular side, then the brittle plastic lids could have been cracked through the cardboard. I wouldn't have mind, if I didn't find, upon closer inspection, that one of the bottles looked like it has been tampered with as the seal has been raised.  Granted it was kinda hot outside (high 80s) when it arrived, so there's a possibility that the seal eroded from the heat. Regardless, I'm not touching something where the seal has been lifted.  So I dunno.  I'll be sending them back tomorrow.","images":[{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71RMkDjy-tL.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71RMkDjy-tL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71RMkDjy-tL._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71myfs2KQUL.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71myfs2KQUL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71myfs2KQUL._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71nudrBY9rL.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71nudrBY9rL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71nudrBY9rL._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71obVCY4P3L.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71obVCY4P3L._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71obVCY4P3L._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71wCUESYNXL.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71wCUESYNXL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71wCUESYNXL._SL256_.jpg"},{"attachment_type":"IMAGE","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71y7GPDuPyL.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71y7GPDuPyL._SL800_.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71y7GPDuPyL._SL256_.jpg"}],"sentiment":"negative","image_url":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71RMkDjy-tL.jpg"}

I would buy a ton of CO Bigelow Mentha lip balm from Bath & Body Works, and it was recently discontinued, so I tried lots and lots of mint chapsticks on Amazon to find something that comes close.<br \/><br \/>Dandy Bee Mint chapstick is so good! It does not have too much of a shine, not greasy, and leaves a cooling sensation. Also, one of my favorite things about my old chapstick was that you could taste the mint and it would freshen your breath a bit, and this Mint lip balm does that. I'm super happy I found finally found a replacement! The Mojito surprised me, it's a combo of lime and mint, so it also has a minty, cool feeling to it, with an added touch of lime. I love it!  Citrus smells like fresh lemon and orange, and the Spiced Orange kind of reminds me of apple cider in the fall.<br \/><br \/>The labels on the tubes also look great. I would definitely recommend this lip balm after trying many other variety packs on Amazon.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

I was so excited for the Lavender & Mint scents, but when I used the lip balms they actually have no scent to them. They smell like unscented chapstick, but a little less worse. Very close to Generic hydrocortisone. I smell tested them together. Pretty close. *Yikes* That smell no one cares for and makes you sick after a while (That's the Lavender). I really like the powerful refreshing smell and feel of a mint lip balm, and the mint gave me none of that. Nothing refreshing at all, I was pretty disappointed. Sigh!

{"text":"Update - May 19 2015:<br \/>Well here we are, one month later, and I just finished my first tube.  I have been rotating between three flavors, mint, cherry, and vanilla, but I always carry one with me.  These things last!  They are much better than any generic I have tried, and my lips aren't a chapped, uncomfortable mess.  I am very happy I tried these and recommend them highly.  A quick word on the flavors I have tried.  I like the mint when I am on the go.  It has a light, natural flavor that is strong enough to notice, but not so strong that it is overwhelming.  The balm is uncolored, so there is no concern about it looking like lip gloss or lipstick.  I like the cherry as a change of pace, but it is tinted a light shade of pink, and while I don't notice the color on my own lips (I have a medium skin tone), I would test it before wearing it in public if color is a concern.  The vanilla, well... different people have different tastes.  I won't say it is bad, but I like the other two flavors much more.  My issue with the vanilla is that the cocoa butter in the balm is very noticeable in scent and flavor, and when I apply it, my mind is immediately taken to thinking &#34;sun block, or sunscreen.&#34;  The fragrance and flavor remind me more of a skin lotion than something I would reach for to put on my lips.  Some people may like that, but I prefer something else.  That, however, is the only negative I found.  The product itself is outstanding, it does exactly what one wants it to do, and saves the user money as compared to using other similar products.  If you are debating on this one, try it.  I don't think you will be disappointed.<br \/>---<br \/>Original review:  April 20, 2015:<br \/>I was a bit skeptical when I saw this - how good can it be at this price?  Well, I don't know how they do it, but this is better than most of the name brand stuff.  It is the perfect price that you can keep it in a pocket and if you happen to lose it, there are plenty more where it came from.  You don't have to think of the cost every time you use it, but the best part is you won't need to reapply frequently (at least I don't, and I tend to go through lip balm quickly.  I have extremely dry lips that are prone to chapping and cracking).  This is my favorite flavor.  It is a very light, natural mint without being overwhelming.  It is lip balm, after all, and not breath freshener.  I also like the black case which is nice and masculine (but they have white and translucent cases for the ladies, too!).  I will definitely buy this again, but with 50 tubes in a batch, that might be a while - and that's not a bad thing, either.","images":[],"sentiment":"positive","image_url":null}

{"text":"I bought this product because it was a good deal. I applied it for to days and already felt my lips on fire and burning but i told myself it could be because it was healing my lips or anything like that. On the 3rd day, I started to notice tiny dots on my lips that I\u2019ve never had (see picture). I paniced and thought it was a serious disease. Stopped using them and used another product and my lips went back normal. And again used it to make sure it was the cause of those little dots and again I had them! Never purchase this product. It contains plenty of chemicals that\u2019re harmful to our systems.

The color is super pigmented and when applied to the lips and cheeks it blends in flawlessly and feels like you have nothing on. There is no sticky or oily finish and it smells amazing! It does have a tingly minty feeling due to the peppermint extract but I enjoy that so it's not problematic for me.
